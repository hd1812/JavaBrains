Idempotence

Get -- read-only method
Post,Put,Delete -- Write method

GET, DELETE, PUT are repeatable
POST is not repeatable

Resource creation requests are not idempotent, so should use POST

Duplicated get request will fetch data from cache
Refresh buttom -- if post, browser warns to submit a form again
